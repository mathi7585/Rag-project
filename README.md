# 🦾 Rag-project

Welcome to **Rag-project** – an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages powerful language models and vector search to answer questions based on uploaded resumes! This project demonstrates how to build a simple QA application using Gradio, FAISS, and Sentence Transformers, making it easy to interact with your own documents.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

**Rag-project** enables users to upload a resume (PDF), which is then processed and indexed for semantic search. By integrating a RAG pipeline, the system retrieves relevant context from the uploaded resume and generates accurate answers to user queries. This approach combines the strengths of information retrieval and language models, resulting in more reliable and context-aware answers.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **Resume Upload:** Easily upload PDF resumes for processing.
- 🧩 **Automatic Chunking:** Resumes are split into manageable text chunks for better context retrieval.
- 🔍 **Semantic Search:** Utilizes FAISS and Sentence Transformers for efficient, relevant search.
- 💬 **QA Chatbot:** Ask questions and receive answers based on the uploaded resume.
- 🌐 **Gradio Interface:** User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.
